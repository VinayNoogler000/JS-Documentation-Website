# JS Documentation Website

## Project Description:

The JS Documentation Website is a comprehensive resource for JavaScript developers. It provides detailed information on various aspects of JavaScript, including an introduction to the language, what you should already know before learning JavaScript, the relationship between JavaScript and Java, a "Hello World" example, and an overview of variables in JavaScript.

This project was created by me as a practice project to enhance and improve fundamental web development skills. The website features a fixed sidebar for easy navigation and a responsive design to ensure it works well on different devices. The sidebar contains links to different sections of the documentation, and the main content area displays the selected section. The website is styled using CSS, ensuring a clean and modern look.

## Features:
- Fixed sidebar for easy navigation.
- Responsive design using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
- Modern and clean UI.
- Navigation bar with a responsive menu for devices with viewport width â‰¤ 800px.
- Detailed documentation sections: Overview, What You Should Already Know, JavaScript and Java, Hello World, and Variables.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML for the structure of the website.
- CSS for styling and layout.
- FontAwesome for icons.
- Responsive design techniques to ensure the website is mobile-friendly.
